    <h2>Sean Lee Brennan</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Sean Brennan. I graduated from the University of Missouri - Columbia (colloquially known as Mizzou) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I am a software engineer at Amazon. Throughout my tenure, I worked on a customer data platform which created unified profiles of both people and businesses from a multitude of 1P & 3P data sets. While I am a dedicated software engineer, I am also a dedicated father to my three-year-old daughter and a dedicated husband to my wife.</p>
